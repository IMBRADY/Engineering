            Week 2
        </h3>
        <p>
            This week consisted of two tinkercad projects. The first project involved us creating a makeshift "Rube Goldberg" project, where we were required to create a mechanism where a baseball leads to popping a balloon with three of the six innovations. The second project was a challenge project where the individual had to create a tinkercad replication of a photo of an object from home. I decided to add my pup due to an extensive length of time.

            Our group chose a final schematic to follow to design for our project. We decided to go with Sebastian's project which consisted of a ramp, lever, and wheel. We learned that designing an E took planning. Without it, one is unable to convey what they expect from their team. One mistake that was made was that my partner forgot part of his design. He did not add a width to his E which made the letter lack a dimension. Without this info, I was unable to create the shape because I did not know what he expected the width to be.

        </h3>
        <p>
            We created boats using an average 8.5 by 11 piece of paper. I looked up an origami boat tutorial online which seemed well due to it having more surface area on the floor. It stayed for an indefinite amount of time due to the class running out of time and requiring me to pick up the boat. Interestingly enough, a plain piece of paper that had no folds seemed to uphold well. Even with weights, it did better than more than half of the boats which were tested by other students.

        <p>
            Our group finished our rube goldberg project. Our first main issue was that the car with the nail went under the balloon and completely missed. We dodged this problem by making our ramp higher in order to not slide under the balloon. Also, we created a balloon shaped indent in the ramp in order for the balloon to be tapped closer to the pathway and therefore gave the car less space which it could use to dodge the balloon.

            Week 6
        </h3>
        <p>
            We spent both days disassembling a laptop using slides which gave us instructions as to what to do. Only issue with this assignment was the lack of knowledge which was given to us by doing this. While teachers may argue that we learned how to take apart a laptop to learn where pieces were, minimal prior information was given to us about said laptop and pieces and no person would be able to recite all ~38 steps in the process of disassembling each piece. The failing of giving the students actual photos of laptop parts like a gpu and cpu lead to the consequential unknowingness radiating from the students from being unable to tell what each piece was. Nonetheless, while I may be a visual learner and believe the slides did not teach much, I did where bigger pieces of a laptop existed since I had general knowledge on the topic.

            Week 7
        </h3>
        <p>
            This week us students created a prosthetic limb for an animal who had a severed body part. It took a lot of research since we had no prior knowledge as to how to create a prosthetic limb. I chose to do an eagle wing which was debatably one of the harder options to perform. Through my research, I found a German engineered material which consisted of polymer which was welded together to melt the plastics and coated with 50 nanometers thick of alumina. This created a lighter than water material which was stronger than steel. I believe that through numerous runs of trial and error (and obviously the materials), us students could have been able to make a somewhat functional limb.

        </h3>
        <p>
            A new projected was presented to us this week which was to design and create a bottle rocket. Through our research, the team decided that a bottle rocket with 3 compartments (being 3 separate bottles) attached to one another would be optimal, since it would be less prone to go off course. The problem arised with the head of the rocket. Although an elliptical top would have been more ideal for aerodynamics, a cone was our best option. We proposed that it could be possible if we made a duct tape ball and use more tape to curve the top, but it weighed down the rocket greatly. A cone did fine, I suppose.

            Week 9
        </h3>
        <p>
            We launched our bottle rocket this week. The 60 psi pressure entering the bottle was unable to be kept as our rocket was multiple attachments of different bottles fused with duct tape. I believe that one bottle would have worked better than what we were intending, since an intense amount of adhesive would have been required in order to achieve this goal of actually flying. Nonetheless, I am proud of the design we came up with, being a high school project and all. I learned that a perfect amount of pressure and water is needed to launch the rocket to its true distance considering that water seemed to be the downfall of most of these rockets since the rocket would not spew out the liquid fast enough and was a constant rush of pressure, letting the rocket have more time to spin. I remember in eigth grade there was no water with our bottle rocket which allowed it to fly unlike these rockets since it was only an initial burst of speed

            Week 10
        </h3>
        <p>
            Using tinkercad, us students created a parallel and series circuit with LED lights using a breadboard and 9V battery. We utilized formulas involving voltage, resistance, and current. I learned that a current always travels from positive to negative. I understand that teachers or students may read this without my knowledge, but I want to get out the fact that the less the teachers know about the topic they're teaching, the less the students will understand, and this lesson of electrical engineering felt, with all do respect, completely improved by teachers who had little knowledge on electrical engineering
