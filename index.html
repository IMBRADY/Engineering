            This week consisted of two tinkercad projects. The first project involved us creating a makeshift "Rube Goldberg" project, where we were required to create a mechanism where a baseball leads to popping a balloon with three of the six innovations. The second project was a challenge project where the individual had to create a tinkercad replication of a photo of an object from home. I decided to add my pup due to an extensive length of time.

            Our group chose a final schematic to follow to design for our project. We decided to go with Sebastian's project which consisted of a ramp, lever, and wheel. We learned that designing an E took planning. Without it, one is unable to convey what they expect from their team. One mistake that was made was that my partner forgot part of his design. He did not add a width to his E which made the letter lack a dimension. Without this info, I was unable to create the shape because I did not know what he expected the width to be.

            We created boats using an average 8.5 by 11 piece of paper. I looked up an origami boat tutorial online which seemed well due to it having more surface area on the floor. It stayed for an indefinite amount of time due to the class running out of time and requiring me to pick up the boat. Interestingly enough, a plain piece of paper that had no folds seemed to uphold well. Even with weights, it did better than more than half of the boats which were tested by other students.

        </h3>
        <p>
            Our group finished our rube goldberg project. Our first main issue was that the car with the nail went under the balloon and completely missed. We dodged this problem by making our ramp higher in order to not slide under the balloon. Also, we created a balloon shaped indent in the ramp in order for the balloon to be tapped closer to the pathway and therefore gave the car less space which it could use to dodge the balloon.

            Week 6
        </h3>
        <p>
            We spent both days disassembling a laptop using slides which gave us instructions as to what to do. Only issue with this assignment was the lack of knowledge which was given to us by doing this. While teachers may argue that we learned how to take apart a laptop to learn where pieces were, minimal prior information was given to us about said laptop and pieces and no person would be able to recite all ~38 steps in the process of disassembling each piece. The failing of giving the students actual photos of laptop parts like a gpu and cpu lead to the consequential unknowingness radiating from the students from being unable to tell what each piece was. Nonetheless, while I may be a visual learner and believe the slides did not teach much, I did where bigger pieces of a laptop existed since I had general knowledge on the topic.
